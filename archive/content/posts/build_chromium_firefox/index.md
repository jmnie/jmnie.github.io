## Preface

Build project from source code is always an interesting stuff. This blog is about how to build chromium and firefox from source code.

Note: Actuallt it's not a blog, it's a small guidance for how to get through the whole workflow (Especially in some regions requiring proxy or VPN to access the chromium source code repository.)

## Build chromium from source code

## Reference Links

The guidance is edited from an internal wiki page. Tried several times, very useful. Before the main content, here are some useful official links for Chromium project:

Here is the official link for building chromium on different platforms:
[The Chromium Projects](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code)

Official Guidance for building Chromium for Windows (A little verbose and more universal):
[Build Chromium on Windows](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md)

[Chromium Embedded Framework, CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/) is a project for maintaining different branches of chromium source code and related work of chromium itself.

Here are 3 links that's useful in building chromium from the CEF project:

It's a wrap-up link for setting up on different OS.

A description which involves more details in environment variables and related configuration (on Windows).

These are environment settings for preparations of building chromium on Windows.

### Build Chromium

After installing the Visual Studio and setting the environment variables, next step is to fetch the source code from Chromium source code repository. The following table is a detailed instruction (Note: ** Follow the step exactly one by one, especially setting the proxy **)

## Build FireFox from source code

Build from FireFox from source code is pretty easier.

### Reference Links

Here is the link for buidling Firefox on Windows (won't paste the content here, just follow the instructions):

[Build FireFox on Windows](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html)

Remarks on the note:

1. Install Python 3.x and Python 2.7 (not sure why the script still requires Python2 dependency, and set the environment variables on Windows if multiple versions of Python did not work as expected )
2. When set the system proxy, remember to set the following:
   - http proxy
   - https proxy (when set https proxy, use http://your_proxy removing 's')
   - socks5 proxy (crucial)
3. If the toolchain 'mach' failed on certain steps, just perform some other actions.

### Building Old Versions FireFox

(This section is added on 2021/04/08 ) When build FireFox with some lower versions, there are several problems I have seen:

1. The Rust version is not compatiable
2. The script (Mainly in Python, for the purpose to update) needs to sync with the server and check the versions.
