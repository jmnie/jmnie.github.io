Some Qutoes: 

> "_Oh God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space,_"
> "_were it not that I have bad dreams._"
> "_Small? No, I could live in a walnut shell and feel like the king of the universe._"

    ------- Hamlet, Act 2 Sene 2, William Shakespeare


> "_Do not quench your inspiration and your imagination;_"
> "_do not become the slave of your model._"

    ------- Vincent Van Gogh
